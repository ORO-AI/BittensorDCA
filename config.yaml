# BLACKLIST: Never stake in these subnets
exclude_list: []

# WHITELIST: ONLY stake in these subnets (takes precedence over exclude_list)
# When non-empty, the bot will ONLY DCA into these subnets
include_list: []
# Example: include_list: [107]  # Only DCA into subnet 107

# MEV PROTECTION: Maximum acceptable slippage/price impact
# 0.02 = 2% max slippage. Lower = more protection but may reject more trades
max_slippage: 0.02

# LIQUIDITY PROTECTION: Minimum ratio of pool liquidity to stake amount
# 10.0 means pool must have at least 10x your stake amount in liquidity
# Note: With 10x ratio, max price impact is ~9.1% - this is by design
min_liquidity_ratio: 10.0

# Preference multipliers (optional - only needed if DCA-ing across multiple subnets)
# Default is 1.0 for any subnet not listed
# Example: "22": 2.0 would double the score for subnet 22
preferences:
  "0": 0.0  # Never select root network
